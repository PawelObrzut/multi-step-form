# Multi Step Form from Frontmentor

An advanced challenge from Frontmentor which I completed using a typescript react vite setup.


## Features

Responsive layout, which required a solid structure to keep the project clean and maintanable.
From with multiple types of inputs, validation, variations and a summary.

## Refactoring

With a project like this one learns to devote a significant attention to clean up the code. Make every component be responsible for just one thing, put the logic in utils functions and cetralize data. A react-form-hook proved to be a great choice to archive required functionality.
